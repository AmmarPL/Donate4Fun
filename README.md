# Donate4Fun

## Requirements
You will need to download
1) Node.js
2) Pugjs
3) MongoDB

## How to Run
1) Run "npm i"
2) Run "npm start"

## Inspiration
We noticed that apps in the fields of fitness, education, social media, etc., use gamification to keep people engaged with the platform. These tricks include tracking points, maintaining leaderboards, and sending rewards. We thought this sort of gamification could be an asset to society if used to increase engagement in a charity app.

## What it does
Our app lets users donate to charities in their area and rewards them with points, badges, and feedback. Users get points based on the amount of items donated, and receive extra points for dropping off the items themselves. They can redeem the points for real life rewards.

## How we built it
We used Node.js for the backend, Pugjs for the frontend, and mongoDB as our database. We used leaflet framework for plotting and visualizing geospatial data

## Challenges we ran into
Challenged for us included integrating different modules of the app together, coming up with a plan for the supply chain process, and integrating the maps API into our app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of the fact that we created an app for potential to be used for good.

## What we learned
We learned that having a good architecture and design for the app at the beginning is very important. Further, collaboration is necessary to create something like this in a short time.
